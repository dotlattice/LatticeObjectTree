# LatticeObjectTree [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/uptdctnkaitlyslg)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dotlattice/latticeobjecttree)

LatticeObjectTree is a .NET library for working with a tree of objects.  It includes a class to compare two objects recursively and a class to generate C# code from an object, but it is designed to be extensible to other applications.

More documentation coming soon (I hope).
